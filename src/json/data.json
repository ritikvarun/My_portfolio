     "D":"Hey there, I'm Ritik Varun, a BCA student and an aspiring Full Stack Developer currently focused on building a strong foundation in MERN stack development. I’m currently pursuing my BCA degree at Uttam Institute of Technology and Management (affiliated with Dr. Bhim Rao Ambedkar University, Agra). I love working on projects that combine modern web technologies with fresh ideas—whether it’s creating responsive, scalable websites or exploring AI tools. I enjoy pushing my limits and learning every day. Apart from coding, I stay curious about design and emerging technologies, because in today’s fast-changing digital world, I believe being a lifelong learner is the real superpower.",
